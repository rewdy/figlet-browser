# Figlet Browser

This provides a simple interface to reviewing and previewing the figlet fonts. All the fonts are tagged so that you can find options based off of what you're trying to do. Should be kind of fun.

## How

* Rendering via node [figlet](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js)
* Site build with [Vite](https://v2.vitejs.dev/)
* Dependencies delightfully managed with [Bun](https://bun.sh) ðŸ¥Ÿ
* Code kept tidy with [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev/)
* Major S/O to my favorite simple CSS library [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). Provides all you need and nothing you don't.
