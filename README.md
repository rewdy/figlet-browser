# Figlet Browser

This provides a simple interface to reviewing and previewing the figlet fonts. All the fonts are tagged so that you can find options based off of what you're trying to do. Should be kind of fun.

ðŸ‘‰ Peep it here: [figlet-browser.rewdy.lol](https://figlet-browser.rewdy.lol)

## How

* Rendering via node [figlet](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js)
* Site build with [Vite](https://v2.vitejs.dev/)
* Dependencies delightfully managed with [Bun](https://bun.sh) ðŸ¥Ÿ
* Code kept tidy with [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev/)
* Major S/O to my favorite simple CSS library [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). Provides all you need and nothing you don't.

## TODO

* [ ] Link to repo
* [ ] Link to rewdy.lol
* [ ] "About" someplace
* [ ] Fix multiple tag filtering
* [ ] Add light intro to how to use figlet (node, bash at least)
* [ ] Rotate between a few favorite figlets for the header background
* [ ] Add lolcat option for kicks
* [ ] Add min rows filter
